			<p>&nbsp </p>
			<p>WATER</p>
			<p>&nbsp </p>
			<p>➼</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">As they provide access to some areas at different times, some people in Lobitos receive more water than others. Barrio Centro, which has a smaller population, receives a similar amount of water but has less demand than Nuevo Lobitos, which has a larger population and several hotels and businesses.</p>
			<p>➼</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Due to the lack of clean drinkig water many residants' stuggle to get access to clean drinking water. In Lobitos there are no available data on water flow, the distribution system is manually controlled.</p>
			<p>➼</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">The water supply is unreliable. During a good week, water is available for about two to three hours for three days of the week. Due to shortages, many households have water tanks that they fill up when water is available. Other water sources in the area include two artisanal wells or boreholes, only one of which is currently active but not used much at Ecológica Tallán, a local conservation organisation. Shallow groundwater is also available but it is not regulated; some of the groundwater is brackish with high concentrations of chlorides, sulphates, some metals and coliform bacterias above the levels considered safe for human consumption.</p>
			<p>➼</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Although the increase in tourism will increase the water consumption so wll the amount of money the locals wll get from revene. With extra money the locals will be able to buy more money for themselfs. Also the government will be able to spend more money on upgrading the water pipes and supply of clean drinking water. </p>
			<p>➼</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">The water supply comes from the Rio river, however the water is scarce due to the desert climate and increasing demands of water source. By the increase of tourism they should build the pipe-line underground this will stop the locals trying to tap into the water illegally.</p>

			<p>&nbsp </p>
			<p>ENERGY</p>
			<p>&nbsp </p>
			<p>➼</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Energy costs are very expensive in Lobitos and Piedritas, however with the increase of revenue from tourism the government can fund solar pannels to help the locals with their energy bills.
			<p>➼</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">The locals should paint their house with brighter and lighter colors as it will reflect more energy for less of an impact on the interior temperature.</p>
			<p>➼</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Cooking in Lobitos and Piedritas is done primarily using LPG from portable canisters. Very few households use an electric stove top, and a few also cook using wood or charcoal fires. A 10 kg gas canister costs 40 Sol to refill and 75 Sol for a new tank.</p>
			<p>➼</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">The outages have an extremely detrimental effect on the provision of health services, particularly the preservation of vaccines. The existing energy backup system for the local Medical Centre originated as an idea in the Engineering for People Design Challenge in 2016-2017. The design brief highlighted this issue, and a team from the University of Strathclyde further defined the scope and proposed a solution. Using the team’s idea, EcoSwell installed a UPS in 2019 and is currently looking into renewable energy sources to boost resilience. EcoSwell is investigating solar and wind as options for the local medical centre to ensure there is consistent energy to power the vaccination fridges.</p>
